## DESCRIPTION

1. Problem Overview 
 Cluttered Home Screen: Oversized thumbnails, mixed content types (subscriptions + 
trending + recommendations). 
 Confusing Navigation: Inbox/Notifications combined; unclear icon labels. 
 Autoplay Control Issues: Users can’t easily stop autoplay loops. 
 Visual Overload: Inconsistent theming; busy UI. 
2. Design Goals 
 Simplify navigation (clear sections + labeled icons). 
 Reduce visual noise (balanced spacing, Material 3 styling). 
 Give user control (disable autoplay, focus mode). 
 Improve discoverability (segmented content feed). 
3. Redesigned Screens 
Home Screen 
 Segmented tabs: Subscribed, Recommended, New Uploads. 
 Smaller thumbnails → more videos per scroll. 
 Quick filters for video type (tutorial, vlog, entertainment). 
Video Player Screen 
 Floating control bar with autoplay toggle. 
 “Focus Mode” hides recommended overlay for distraction-free viewing. 
 Ambient adaptive background (video color tone). 
Navigation Bar 
 Separate Messages and Notifications icons. 
 Clear labels under each icon. 
 Consistent bottom bar across all pages. 
Settings 
 Toggle autoplay, focus mode, and theme. 
 Personalized feed customization (show/hide sections).
